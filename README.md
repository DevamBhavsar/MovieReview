# MovieReview

MovieReview is a full-stack application for reviewing and exploring movies. It consists of a server-side component and a client-side React application.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Movie-server: The backend server component
2. Movie-client: The frontend React application

### Movie-server

The server-side component of the MovieReview application. It handles data management, API endpoints, and business logic.

### Movie-client

The client-side of the MovieReview application is built using React and was bootstrapped with Create React App. It's located in the `Movie-client/movie-gold-v1` directory.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the Server

1. Navigate to the `Movie-server` directory
2. Follow the instructions in the server's README.md file to set up and run the server

### Setting up the Client

1. Navigate to the `Movie-client/movie-gold-v1` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm start` to run the app in development mode
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

## Available Scripts (Client)

In the client project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject`: Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)
